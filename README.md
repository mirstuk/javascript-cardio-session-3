### CHALLENGE 1: ADD ALL NUMBERS

Return a sum of all parameters entered regardless of the amount of numbers - NO ARRAYS

ex. addAll(2,5,6,7) === 20

### CHALLENGE 2: SUM ALL PRIMES

Pass in a number to loop up to and add all of the prime numbers. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself

ex. sumAllPrimes(10) == 17
