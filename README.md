### CHALLENGE 1: ADD ALL NUMBERS

Return a sum of all parameters entered regardless of the amount of numbers - NO ARRAYS

ex. addAll(2,5,6,7) === 20

### CHALLENGE 2: SUM ALL PRIMES

Pass in a number to loop up to and add all of the prime numbers. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself

ex. sumAllPrimes(10) == 17

### CHALLENGE 3: SEEK & DESTROY

Remove from the array whatever is in the following arguments. Return the leftover numbers in an array

ex. seekAndDestroy([2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 'hello'], 2, 6) == [3, 4, 'hello']
